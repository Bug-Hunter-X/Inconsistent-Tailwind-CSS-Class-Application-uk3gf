# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied across different components in a React application.  Some classes work as expected, while others are ignored or applied incorrectly. The cause of this inconsistency remains to be determined.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that some elements are not styled correctly according to the Tailwind classes applied.

## Potential solutions (under investigation)

* PurgeCSS configuration issue
* Conflicting CSS rules
* Incorrect class names
* Missing Tailwind directives

This issue has been observed in a specific project, but a simplified reproduction has not yet been confirmed.  Contributions to diagnose the root cause are welcomed.
