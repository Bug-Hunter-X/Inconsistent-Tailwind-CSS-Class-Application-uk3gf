```javascript
// Ensure that your purgeCSS configuration (if using) is correct and includes all necessary components to avoid unexpected stripping of CSS classes.

// Check for any conflicting CSS rules from other libraries or custom styles.

// Double-check all Tailwind class names for accuracy and typos.

// Verify the presence and correctness of any necessary Tailwind directives.  (Consider using `@tailwind base;` `@tailwind components;` and `@tailwind utilities;` in your main CSS file).

// If none of the above work, ensure you have Tailwind CSS setup correctly by checking the Tailwind docs and troubleshooting basics.

// Example of verifying the presence of classes (may require adjustments depending on your framework):

console.log(document.querySelector('.bg-gray-200').classList);

// If your framework does not dynamically apply classes to elements upon mount ensure that the class names are correct within the component itself.
